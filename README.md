# wordleproject
I am trying to create Wordle in Python for a project. I have some code already but need help optimising and fixing it. The answer is set to 'swath' as I have a problem where whenever the guess is of a particular form, 'stats' for instance, the output will be incorrect. In this case, my code outputs GYGG- when it should be G-GG-. 

I know the basics of python but don't hesitate to teach me new modules/commands that would work better as I need to learn the language better.

I am basically new to Github aswell so please give me tips on that aswell :D.

Thank you.
